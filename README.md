This project demonstrates a **production-inspired two-tier architecture** for deploying a containerized **Flask application with MySQL on AWS**. The application runs inside Docker containers on private EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and uses Amazon ECR, VPC Endpoints, CloudWatch, and AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for secure management and monitoring.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a secure and highly available cloud infrastructure following AWS best practices.

* **Air-Gapped Private Network** – Application and database reside inside private subnets.
* **Zero SSH Architecture** – AWS Systems Manager Session Manager replaces SSH access.
* **Private AWS Connectivity** – VPC Endpoints keep traffic off the public internet.
* **Production-Inspired Design** – Mimics real-world DevOps and cloud environments.
